   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### File Structure Understanding

## 📏 Coding Standards

### JavaScript Guidelines

- **Use ES6+ features** where appropriate
- **Follow camelCase** for variable and function names
- **Use const/let** instead of var
- **Add comments** for complex logic
- **Keep functions small** and focused on single tasks

**Example:**

```javascript
// Good
const PADDLE_SPEED = 7;
const ballPosition = { x: 100, y: 200 };

function updateBallPosition() {
  ball.x += ball.dx;
  ball.y += ball.dy;
}

// Avoid
var paddle_speed = 7;
var ball_pos = [100, 200];
```

### CSS Guidelines

- **Use meaningful class names**
- **Follow BEM methodology** where applicable
- **Group related properties**
- **Use consistent indentation** (2 spaces)

**Example:**

```css
/* Good */
.game-canvas {
  border: 2px solid #00adb5;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: #000;
}

.score-display {
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  color: #fff;
}
```

### HTML Guidelines

- **Use semantic HTML5 elements**
- **Include proper meta tags**
- **Ensure accessibility** with alt attributes and proper heading structure

## 🔄 Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Sync with upstream**:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**:

   git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: descriptive commit message"
   ```

### Pull Request Guidelines
